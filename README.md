This repository contains the implementation of a project exploring dimensionality reduction using autoencoders, with a comparison to traditional methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The project uses the MNIST dataset to demonstrate how autoencoders can effectively compress high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional latent space while preserving essential features, outperforming PCA in reconstruction quality and downstream tasks.

The project is based on the report "Dimensionality Reduction Using Autoencoders" and includes code, results, and documentation to replicate the experiments.
